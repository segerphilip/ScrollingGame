Brainstorming:
	High school based dating game
	Week before prom, try to get the most popular date and become prom queen
	"So delightful, yet so awkward"
	Build confidence to ask out more popular people
		asking people out
		going on dates
		attend social events
		alcohol gives short boost of confidence but diminishes quickly
	Based in high school
		multiple floors
		classrooms
		certain areas off limits - if caught you get in trouble
	Can't get thrown out of school - attending class
	???Undergo puberty???
	Missions - get people to go with you
	Press B to smack a bitch
	Learn new skills doing activities in certain parts of the school
		Learn instrument in band room
		Learn sports in gym
		Get swole in weight room
		Make drugs in Chemistry lab
			Pick up ingredients throughout school to make stuff
		Pull prank on teacher
		Learn guitar to win talent show
		Pay nerd to do homework
	Ending:
		Yay, you got to date prom (thing), but you peaked in high school.
		Don't worry, you still went on to university and now make bank!
